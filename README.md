# i18n

Lightweight simple translation module with dynamic json storage. 
Uses common __('...') syntax in app and templates.
Stores language files in json files compatible to [webtranslateit](http://webtranslateit.com/) json format.
Adds new strings on-the-fly when first used in your app.
No extra parsing needed.

# Using with Express.js

## Load and Configure

In your app.js:

	// load modules
	var express = require('express'),
		i18n = require('i18n');

	// Express Configuration
	app.configure(function() {

		// ...

		// Attach the i18n property to the express request object
		// And attach dynamicHelpers for use in templates
		i18n.expressBind(app, {
			// setup some locales - other locales default to en silently
			locales: ['en', 'de']
		}));

		// Set up the rest of the Express middleware
		app.use(app.router);
		app.use(express.static(__dirname + '/public'));
	});

## Inside Your Express View

	module.exports = {
		index: function(req, res) {
			req.render("index", {
				title: req.i18n.__("My Site Title"),
				desc: req.i18n.__("My Site Description")
			});
		}
	};

## Inside Your Templates

(This example uses the Swig templating system.)

	{% extends "page.swig" %}

	{% block content %}
	<h1>{{ __("Welcome to:") }} {{ title }}</h1>
	<p>{{ desc }}</p>
	{% endblock %}

# Using Standalone (without Express)

	// Load Module and Instantiate
	var i18n = require('i18n').create({
		// setup some locales - other locales default to en silently
		locales: ['en', 'de']
	});

	// Use it however you wish
	console.log( i18n.__("Hello!") );

### sprintf support

	var greeting = __('Hello %s, how are you today?', 'Marcus');
	
this puts **Hello Marcus, how are you today?**. You might add endless arguments and even nest it.

	var greeting = __('Hello %s, how are you today? How was your %s.', 'Marcus', __('weekend'));
	
which puts **Hello Marcus, how are you today? How was your weekend.**

### variable support

you might even use dynamic variables. They get added to the `en.js` file if not yet existing.

	var greetings = ['Hi', 'Hello', 'Howdy'];
	for (var i=0; i < greetings.length; i++) {
		console.log( __(greetings[i]) );
	};

which puts 

	Hi
	Hello
	Howdy

### plural support

different plural froms are supported as response to `count`:

	var singular = __n('%s cat', '%s cats', 1);
	var plural = __n('%s cat', '%s cats', 3);

this puts **1 cat** or **3 cats**
and again these could get nested:

	var singular = __n('There is one monkey in the %%s', 'There are %d monkeys in the %%s', 1, 'tree');
	var plural = __n('There is one monkey in the %%s', 'There are %d monkeys in the %%s', 3, 'tree');

putting **There is one monkey in the tree** or **There are 3 monkeys in the tree**

## Storage

### json file

the above will automatically generate a `en.js` by default inside `./locales/` which looks like

	{
		"Hello": "Hello",
		"Hello %s, how are you today?": "Hello %s, how are you today?",
		"weekend": "weekend",
		"Hello %s, how are you today? How was your %s.": "Hello %s, how are you today? How was your %s.",
		"Hi": "Hi",
		"Howdy": "Howdy",
		"%s cat": {
			"one": "%s cat",
			"other": "%s cats"
		},
		"There is one monkey in the %%s": {
			"one": "There is one monkey in the %%s",
			"other": "There are %d monkeys in the %%s"
		},
		"tree": "tree"
	}

that file can be edited or just uploaded to [webtranslateit](http://docs.webtranslateit.com/file_formats/) for any kind of collaborative translation workflow:

	{
		"Hello": "Hallo",
		"Hello %s, how are you today?": "Hallo %s, wie geht es dir heute?",
		"weekend": "Wochenende",
		"Hello %s, how are you today? How was your %s.": "Hallo %s, wie geht es dir heute? Wie war dein %s.",
		"Hi": "Hi",
		"Howdy": "HallÃ¶chen",
		"%s cat": {
			"one": "%s Katze",
			"other": "%s Katzen"
		},
		"There is one monkey in the %%s": {
			"one": "Im %%s sitzt ein Affe",
			"other": "Im Baum sitzen %d Affen"
		},
		"tree": "Baum"
	}

to turn off automatic locale file updates:

	// turn off locale file updating in production mode
	i18n.configure({
		// disable locale file updates
		updateFiles: false
	});
